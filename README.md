## Description

This application is to showcase my skill with the technologies listed below. It was created in under 3 hours and with no prior experience with Chakra UI.

## Technologies used

 - Next.js
 - Node.js
 - Chakra UI
 - Typescript

## Thought process
I wanted to showcase my ability to create something quickly while still maintaining code readability and showcasing a solid understanding of the technologies used. So I decided to give myself a time limit to complete this project. 

This would prevent me from styling the application to a professional level since I am not 100% familiar with Chakra UI, but it allows me to demonstrate my ability to read documentation quickly and get started working on the codebase.
## Getting started
Start by cloning the project.

Then cd into server and run one of the following commands

    npm install
    // or
    yarn install
Once installed you can run 

    npm start
    // or
    yarn start
    
Then cd into client and run one of the following commands


    npm install
    // or
    yarn install
Once installed you can run

    npm dev
    // or
    yarn dev
